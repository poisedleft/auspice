abstract: "Haiti is currently experiencing its worse outbreak of the pandemic, driven primarily by the P.1 variant. This is an early look at sequences released by the country's National Public Health Laboratory (Laboratoire National de Sante Publique) to GISAID. After sporadic sequencing through 2020 and early 2021 the lab released about 40 sequences taken in May, at about the time the epidemic was noticebly picking up. This batch of samples seem to have mostly come from a single introduction, estimated to have occured no later than March with the variant spreading locally through early spring before being officially detected. It's possible/probable that had genetic sequencing been available earlier the presence and spread of the variant may have alerted public health authorities to the threat sooner. While the current outbreak is serious enough as it is, it is imperative to support the country's sequencing capability to monitor future threats, noteably delta"

The vast majority of the new samples are P.1

There are a handful of introductions, but most of these samples fall within a single clade. The genetic diversity is suggestive of in country transmission beginning in February-March. Given the lack of actual samples this is a statistical conclusion only, however introduction around that time would be consistent with geography/travel patterns (there are direct flights from Sao Paulo to Port-au-Prince as well as other cities in South America).
